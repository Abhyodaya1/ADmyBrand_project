```

**Usage**: This prompt was input into Lovable to generate a Vite-based prototype with initial components and a dark black theme, which served as the foundation for the Next.js conversion.

### Prompt 2: Advanced Lovable Prompt — Footer + Animated Reviews & Pricing Cards

This prompt, provided to **Grok**, enhanced the design with a cohesive footer, interactive Testimonials carousel, and animated Pricing cards, emphasizing responsiveness and lavender accents.

```markdown
The current design is looking absolutely stunning — especially the header — and I’m loving the overall vibe. Now, to complete the visual harmony, I would love you to craft a matching footer that feels cohesive and vibrant, featuring social media icons/links (like Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook) neatly aligned with a minimalistic yet elegant layout.

For the reviews/testimonials section, please ensure it is horizontally scrollable by hand gestures (touch scroll on mobile devices) and gracefully draggable with a mouse on desktops, giving it an interactive carousel feel without autoplay.

Make sure the entire layout is fluidly responsive across all devices, especially on mobile and tablets, with optimized spacing, typography, and adaptive grid/flex layouts that adjust perfectly to screen sizes.

Additionally, I’d like you to enhance the transitions and hover effects throughout the design — introduce subtle micro-interactions like icon hover glows, button ripple effects, and smooth sliding animations with a soft purple hue accent (lavender gradients or blurred purple overlays) to evoke a warm and lovable user experience.

Let’s make every scroll, click, and hover feel intuitive, delightful, and modern.
```

**Usage**: Grok used this prompt to implement the Footer with social media icons, a horizontally scrollable Testimonials carousel (`TestimonialsSection.tsx`), and lavender-accented micro-interactions (e.g., hover glows, ripple effects). The responsive layout was refined to ensure fluid grid/flex adjustments.

### Prompt 3: Ultimate Design Prompt — "Omnichannel Glow"

This prompt, also provided to **Grok**, transformed the site into a premium, futuristic design with a dark black theme, purple-blue glowing accents, and glassmorphism effects tailored to ADmyBRAND’s omnichannel advertising identity.

```markdown
The design looks stunning, and now I want to elevate it to a next-gen, premium visual identity. My brand is the largest platform for omnichannel advertising, so the entire layout should reflect innovation, connectivity, and futuristic elegance.

Please redesign the entire section to embrace a Dark Black Theme with Purple-Blue glowing accents. Use Glassmorphism effects (frosted glass panels with light blur, translucent cards, and neon glow edges) to give a sense of depth and modernity.

The Footer should maintain a minimalistic layout but should feel alive with glowing social icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook) that have hover ripple effects with a purple-blue neon glow.

For the Reviews/Testimonials section, continue with the horizontal hand-scrollable/draggable layout, but now, integrate a 3D flipping animation (Y-axis flip-in) with a glass-card look — like flipping digital glass tiles with glowing edges.

The Pricing Cards should appear with a smooth flip-in from the back as the user scrolls, with a blurred-glass look and glowing outlines. The background should have subtle purple-blue gradients and blurred circular glow spots to create a sense of depth and luxury.

Use high-quality imagery that represents omnichannel advertising, digital touchpoints, AI-driven marketing, and global connectivity — think of visuals with people interacting across multiple devices, holographic interfaces, network grids, etc. Place them smartly within glass panels or as background overlays.

The entire site should be fully responsive, ensuring that all animations, scroll gestures, and visual effects work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Integrate smooth transitions, hover interactions, and micro animations everywhere — button clicks should have soft ripple effects with purple hues, card hovers should slightly tilt or glow, and scrolls should trigger gentle parallax shifts and fade-ins.

Overall, the design must exude a futuristic, lovable, premium tech feel, where users feel they are interacting with an elite-level, innovative advertising platform.
```

**Usage**: Grok applied this prompt to overhaul the design with a dark black theme, purple-blue glowing accents, and glassmorphism effects. The Testimonials and Pricing sections were enhanced with 3D flip-in animations, and high-quality imagery (e.g., holographic interfaces, network grids) was integrated. The Footer was updated with glowing social icons.
